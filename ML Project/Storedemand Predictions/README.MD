# Predict Store Demand Forecast
### 1.0 Objective
The objective of this project is to predict 3 months of item-level sales data at different store locations.
Data fields description
- date - Date of the sale data. There are no holiday effects or store closures.
- store - Store ID
- item - Item ID
- sales - Number of items sold at a particular store on a particular date.
### 2.0 Data Loading and Visualization Import data set
### 3.0 Decomposition
### 4.0 Stationary Check 
  - ### 4.1 Rolling Statistics Methodology
  - ### 4.2 ADF(Augmented Dickey-Fuller)
Test For a Time series to be stationary, its ADF test should have: low p-value (according to the null hypothesis) Critical values at 1%, 5%, 10% confidence intervals should be as close as possible to the Test Statistic
### 5.0 Data Transformation to achieve StationarityÂ¶
We can try to achive stationary using different methods like log scale, moving average,Exponential decay transformation,Time shift transformation.
  - ### 5.1 Log Scale Transformation
  - ### 5.2 Log Scale - Moving Average Transformation
  - ### 5.3 Exponential Decay Transformation
  - ### 5.4 Time Shift Transformation
### 6.0 Plotting ACF & PACF
### 7.0 Building Models
  - ### 7.1 ARMA Model 
  - ### 7.2 ARIMA Model
### 8.0 Prediction & Reverse transformations of fitted values
### 9.0 Forecasting the Store Sales for next 3 Months
We have 3(existing data of 3 months) data points. 
### 10.0 Using plot_predict method
### 11.0 Conclusion
Using ARIMA model our forcast and actual almost in line with the predictions
