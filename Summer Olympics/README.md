## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <br>

**Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)** is an **approach to analyzing data sets** to **summarize** their **main characteristics**, often with **visual methods**. 


- It includes **cleaning, munging, combining, reshaping, slicing, dicing, and transforming data** for **analysis** purpose.


- The **primary goal of EDA** is to **maximize the analyst's insight into a data set** and into the **underlying structure of a data set**, while **providing all of the specific items** that an **analyst would want to extract from a data set**, such as:
 <br>
  - A list of **outliers**.<br>
  
  - A **good-fitting model**.  <br>
  
  - **Estimates for parameters**.<br>
  
  - **Uncertainties** for those **estimates**.<br>
  
  - A **ranked list** of **important factors**.<br>
  
  - **Conclusions** as to whether **individual factors are statistically significant**.<br>
  
  - A **sense of robustness of conclusions**.<br>
  
  - **Optimal settings**.<br>
